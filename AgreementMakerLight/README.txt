|  AML is a lightweight ontology matching system specialized   |
|  on the biomedical domain but applicable to any ontologies.  |
|  It can be used to generate alignments automatically, as a   |
|  platform for reviewing alignments, or as an alignment       |
|  repair system (both automatically and interactively).       |
|  AML has achieved top resuls in the last two editions of the |
|  Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative:                   |
|  - D. Faria, C. Martins, A. Nanavaty, et al. "AML Results    |
|  for OAEI 2015", ISWC Workshop on Ontology Matching, 2015.   |

|  The AML GUI uses Gephi, an open source graph visualization  |
|  and manipulation software. Like AML, Gephi is lightweight   |
|  and efficient.                                              |
